### 1.2 Von Neumann Model

[Von Neumann model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) gives a more concrete description of the construction of computers: A computer has four basic components, *memory*, *arithmetic logic unit*, *control unit*, and *input/output*. Being different from the Turing model, in the von Neumann model, programs can be stored in the computerâ€™s memory.
