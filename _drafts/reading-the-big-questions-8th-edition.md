## Preface

What kind of war was the Napoleonic war? What is the connection with the ideal of "liberty, equality, fraternity" born in France?

> Hegel and his students felt confident, even cheerful. Why? Because they had a **philosophy**. They had a vision of themselves and the future that allowed them to face the loss of their jobs, even the destruction of their society and the considerable chaos that would follow. Their ideas inspired them and made even the most threatening circumstances meaningful.
