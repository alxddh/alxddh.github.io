## Preface

The author talks Hegel and Hegel's book [*The Phenomenology of Spirit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit) in the beginning, is for conceiving one opinion: **Philosophy** is useful for people to face the changes in the world. The book was hastily finishing when Napoleon’s battle was about to begin.

> The book was a vision of consciousness caught in the midst of gigantic forces and looking for direction in a new and terrifyingly human world. It was an appeal for hope and thoughtful effort toward universal understanding and a belief in what was then innocently called the “perfectibility of humanity.”

### The Subject of Philosophy

> Philosophy is nothing less than the attempt to understand who we are and what we think of ourselves.

## Introduction -- Doing Philosophy

> Philosophy is all about our beliefs and attitudes about ourselves and the world. Doing philosophy, therefore, is first of all the activity of stating, as clearly and as convincingly as possible, what we believe and what we believe in. This does not mean, however, that announcing one’s allegiance to some grand-sounding ideas or, perhaps, some impressive word or “ism” is all that there is to philosophy. Philosophy is the development of these ideas, the attempt to work them out with all their implications and complications. It is the attempt to see their connections and compare them with other people’s views—including the classic statements of the great philosophers of the past. It is the effort to appreciate the differences between one’s own views and others’ views, to be able to argue with someone who disagrees and resolve the difficulties that they may throw in your path.

### Beyond Buzzwords

> Definition of *buzzword*
> 
> 1: an important-sounding usually technical word or phrase often of little meaning used chiefly to impress laymen
> 
> 2: a voguish word or phrase
>
> -- [https://www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buzzword)

For example, freedom, truth, reality, morality, love, and God. To avoid using buzzwords, philosophers need to define their own terms.

> In fact, it is very difficult to define your terms, and most of the time, the definition emerges at the *end* of the thought process rather than at the beginning.
