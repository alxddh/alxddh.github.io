## Chapter 1. Data Storage

### 1.1 Bits and Their Storage

#### Gates and FlipÂ­-Flops

> A flip-flop is a fundamental unit of computer memory. It is a circuit that produces an output value of 0 or 1, which remains constant until a pulse (a temporary change to a 1 that returns to 0) from another circuit causes it to shift to the other value. In other words, the output can be set to "remember" a zero or a one under control of external stimuli.

At the normal state, both inputs are set to zeros, and we can easily see that the output value can be 0 or 1. When the upper input receives a pulse, the output shifts to 1 and then remains constant. When the lower input receives a pulse, the output shifts to 0 and then remains constant.

From the outside perspective, this implementation is the same as the first one, but it has one benefit that it only needs two different kinds of gate.
