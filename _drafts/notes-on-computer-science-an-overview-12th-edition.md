Here are my notes on [*Computer Science: An Overview*, 12th Edition (Global Edition, 2015)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XN4D0BQ) by J. Glenn Brookshear and [Dennis Brylow](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/).

## Chapter 1. Data Storage

### 1.1 Bits and Their Storage

#### Gates and FlipÂ­-Flops

A *flip-flop* is a fundamental unit of computer memory. It is a circuit that produces 0 or 1, which remains constant until a *pulse* (a temporary change to 1 that return 0) from another circuit causes it to shift to the other value. In other words, a flip-flop can remember bits and the value can be modified.

In the normal state, both inputs are at zeros. If the upper input receives a pulse, the output would shift to 1 and then remains constant. If the lower input receives a pulse, the output would shift to 0 and then remains constant.

This implementation has one benefit that it only uses two kinds of gate.
