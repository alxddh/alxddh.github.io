## 1. Atoms in Motion

### 1–2 Matter is made of atoms

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the *atomic hypothesis* (or the atomic *fact*, or whatever you wish to call it) that *all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another*.

## 4. Conservation of Energy

### 4–1 What is energy?

Feynman described that energy is a mathematical quantity that does not change when something happens. However, the word "energy" gives us a feeling that it is a magical power that can push a system to work.
