### Chapter 7. From Many Rules to One Habit

If a book is worth to read, it is worth to read three times in different ways:

1. *Structural* or *analytic*.
   1. Know the subject the book is about.
   2. Know what the book as a whole is trying to say.
   3. Know what parts that whole is divided.
   4. Know what the main problems are that the author is trying to solve.
2. *Interpretative* or *synthetic*.
   1. Discover and interpret the most important **words**.
   2. Discover and interpret the most important **sentences**.
   3. Discover and interpret the most important **paragraphs**.
   4. Know which of **problems** the author solved, and which he failed on.
3. *Critical* or *evaluative*.
