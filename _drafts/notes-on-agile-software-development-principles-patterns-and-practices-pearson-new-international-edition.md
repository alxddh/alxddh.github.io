### 1. Agile Practices

#### The Agile Alliance

*The Manifesto of the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/)*:

> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan

**Working software over comprehensive documentation**. The author thinks that too many documents are worse than too little because it's difficult to keep the documents be sync with the software. He said, all we need is a short rationale and structured document, and we can train new members by talking with them.

### 2. Overview of Extreme Programming
